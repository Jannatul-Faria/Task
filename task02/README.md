# Problem on Array Sorting
### Task Overview
Given an array of different numbers and a target number, after sorting this array, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

### Example Test Cases:
Test Case 1: <br>
Input: nums = [1,7,3,5,6,9,15], target = 5 <br>
Output: 2 <br>
Test Case 2: <br>
Input: nums = [5,6,1,3], target = 2 <br>
Output: 1<br>
Test Case 3: <br>
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7 <br>
Output: 4
### Solution Approach
The PHP solution implements a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the sorted array. If the target number is found, it returns its index. If not, it determines the index where it would be inserted in order.

### How to Use
Ensure you have PHP installed on your system. <br>
Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url> <br>
Navigate to the directory containing the PHP file. <br>
Open the PHP file in a text editor or IDE. <br>
Modify the test cases or add your own test cases as needed. <br>
Run the PHP file in your terminal or command prompt.
